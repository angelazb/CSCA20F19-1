# Filer

A simple Python program which renames the files in a folder.

**Note**: Your TV shows (etc.) should already be in lexicographical (alphabetical) order in the folder they are in. They will be renumbered based on this order.

## Requirements

- Python3

## Build  and run

- Download `filer.py`
- Double-click `filer.py`
- Where prompted, type the full or relative path the folder in which you would like to rename files.
    - E.G. `C:\Users\Daniela\My Videos\Firefly\Season 2` is an absolute path and works wherever `filer.py` is.
    - E.G. `Season 2` is a relative path and works if you run this program from the `Firefly` directory.
- Next, select how you would like to rename your files and the relevant options, as prompted.
