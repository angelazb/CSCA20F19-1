    Hello, welcome to my little website.
    I hope you can find some stuff here that helps you succeed in this course.
</p>

<hr/>

<p>
    I hope to post small examples of code as well as links and general advice over 
    the term. This website is a learning process for me, too, so if there's something
    you'd like to see that isn't here, let me know.
</p>

    The best way to ask as question is with a thoughtful post on 
    <a href="https://piazza.com/class/k03z36u0gnids">Piazza</a>
    so that your classmates can also benefit.
</p>
<p>
    If you'd prefer to speak in person, feel free to come to any of my tutorials.

        <li>Friday: 11:00-13:00 (BV-469)</li>
    </ul>
    As long as we're not too busy, I'd be happy to help.

    You could also <a href=javascript:window.location.href=atob('bWFpbHRvOmpvZS5hcm1pdGFnZUBtYWlsLnV0b3JvbnRvLmNh')>email me</a>. 
    However, unless you have something private to discuss, you'd do better to post to Piazza.
