    Hello, welcome to my little website.
    I hope you can find some stuff here that helps you succeed in this course.
</p>

<p>
    I hope to post small examples of code as well as links and general advice over 
    the term. This website is a learning process for me, too, so if there's something
    you'd like to see that isn't here, let me know.
