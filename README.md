## Build and Run
This command should work on any machine with Python, as long
as the command is being run from a command line (BASH, CMD, etc.)
whose current working directory is a local copy of the root of this
repository:

```
python3 -m http.server --directory site --bind 127.0.0.42
```

It may be necessary to replace "python3" with just "python" on **Windows**.
